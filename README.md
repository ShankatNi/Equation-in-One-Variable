Solutions of Equations in One Variable

I have attached methods used in numerical approximation on root-finding problem. This process involves finding a root, or solution, of an equation of the form f(x)=0, for a given function f. 
A root of this equation is also called a zero of the function f.

Newtonâ€™s Method: It is one of the most powerful and well-known numerical methods for solving a root-finding problem. 
Secant Method: It is a slight variation from Newtons Method. Because Newtons Method requires us to know the value of the derivative of f at each approximation
